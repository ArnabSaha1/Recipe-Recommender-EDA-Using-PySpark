## Problem Statement:
Food.com is afood recipe website where an user posts the food recipes and other users rate and comment on it. As an ML engineer working at food.com. Your job is to design a recommender system to recommend recipes 
to users based on their choice and the current recipe they are looking at. The recommendation engine is a way to increase the website's user engagement. If a user is shown relevant recipes, they are more likely to spend more time on your site reading about recipes. Higher user engagement will likely result in more business opportunities like collaborations, promotions, etc.â€“The performance of a recommendation engine will significantly impact the revenue your recipe site can generate.
